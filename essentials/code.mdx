## How it works

Genericized text will first collect character frequencies of your text.

```
FFFFFRRRROOOMMS

F = 5
R = 4
O = 3
M = 2
S = 1
```

It will then associate the most frequent character with the letter A, the next most frequent character with the letter B, so on and so forth.

```
F = A
R = B
O = C
M = D
S = E
```

Finally, it will replace the characters accordingly in your ciphertext to now be the genericized text.

```
FFFFFRRRROOOMMS
AAAAABBBBCCCDDE
```

## Code blocks

Use [fenced code blocks](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#fenced-code-blocks) by enclosing code in three backticks and follow the leading ticks with the programming language of your snippet to get syntax highlighting. Optionally, you can also write the name of your code after the programming language.

```java HelloWorld.java
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

```java HelloWorld.java
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```
